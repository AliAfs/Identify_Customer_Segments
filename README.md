# Project: Identify Customer Segments

*Identify Customer Segment Project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program*

## Introduction

In this project, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The goal is to use these segments to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data has been provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and represents a real-life data science task.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

### Step 0: Load the Data
Load the demographics data for the general population and the feature attributes summary.

### Step 1: Preprocessing
#### Step 1.1: Assess Missing Data
- Convert missing value codes to NaNs.
- Assess missing data in each column.
- Assess missing data in each row.

#### Step 1.2: Select and Re-Encode Features
- Check for the data type of each feature.
- Re-encode categorical features.
- Engineer mixed-type features.
- Complete feature selection.

#### Step 1.3: Create a Cleaning Function
- Create a function for data cleaning to be used for the customer demographics data.

### Step 2: Feature Transformation
#### Step 2.1: Apply Feature Scaling
- Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler.

#### Step 2.2: Perform Dimensionality Reduction
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

#### Step 2.3: Interpret Principal Components
- Interpret the principal components by analyzing the weights of each variable.

### Step 3: Clustering
#### Step 3.1: Apply Clustering to General Population
- Apply k-means clustering to the general population and determine the optimal number of clusters.

#### Step 3.2: Apply All Steps to the Customer Data
- Apply the same feature wrangling, selection, and engineering steps to the customer demographics using the clean_data() function.

#### Step 3.3: Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
- Compare the cluster distributions between the general population and the customer data.

## Discussion
Throughout the notebook, discussions are provided to explain the decisions made during each step and to interpret the findings. These discussions help in understanding the insights gained from the data analysis.

By the end of the notebook, we have identified clusters that are overrepresented and underrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population. We have also interpreted the characteristics of these clusters using the principal components.

The insights obtained from this analysis can be used to tailor marketing strategies and target specific audience segments more effectively.
